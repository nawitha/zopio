## Usage

Zopio is designed to be intuitive. Hereâ€™s how to get started with some common tasks:

### Creating a New Component

1. Navigate to the `components` directory.
2. Create a new file, e.g., `MyComponent.tsx`.
3. Define your component:

   ```tsx
   import React from 'react';

   const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
       return <div>Hello, Zopio!</div>;
   };

   export default MyComponent;
   ```

4. Import and use your component in a page:

   ```tsx
   import MyComponent from '../components/MyComponent';

   const HomePage: React.FC = () => {
       return (
           <div>
               <h1>Welcome to Zopio</h1>
               <MyComponent />
           </div>
       );
   };

   export default HomePage;
   ```

### Making API Calls

Zopio simplifies API calls using built-in hooks. Hereâ€™s how to fetch data:

1. Create a new file in the `hooks` directory, e.g., `useFetch.ts`.
2. Define your hook:

   ```tsx
   import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

   const useFetch = (url: string) => {
       const [data, setData] = useState(null);
       const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

       useEffect(() => {
           const fetchData = async () => {
               const response = await fetch(url);
               const result = await response.json();
               setData(result);
               setLoading(false);
           };

           fetchData();
       }, [url]);

       return { data, loading };
   };

   export default useFetch;
   ```

3. Use your hook in a component:

   ```tsx
   import useFetch from '../hooks/useFetch';

   const DataDisplay: React.FC = () => {
       const { data, loading } = useFetch('/api/data');

       if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
       return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
   };
   ```
